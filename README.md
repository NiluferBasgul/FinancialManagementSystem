The Financial Management API provides a set of services for managing financial transactions and data. The API is designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to use

Services
The Financial Management API provides the following services:

Transaction Service: This service allows users to create, read, update, and delete financial transactions.
Account Service: This service allows users to manage their financial accounts, including creating, updating, and deleting accounts.
Reporting Service: This service provides financial reports, such as balance sheets and income statements.
API
The API is designed to be RESTful and uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. The API uses JSON as the default data format.

Authentication
The Financial Management API uses token-based authentication. Users must provide a valid token to access the API. The token can be obtained by authenticating with the API using a valid username and password.

Middleware
The Financial Management API uses middleware to handle requests and responses. The middleware is responsible for tasks such as authentication, request validation, and response formatting.

Model
The Financial Management API uses a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. The model represents the data and business logic of the application. The view is the user interface, and the controller handles user input and updates the view.

The model for the Financial Management API includes the following:

Transaction: Represents a financial transaction, including the amount, date, and account information.
Account: Represents a financial account, including the balance, name, and type.
Report: Represents a financial report, including the balance sheet and income statement.
The model also includes validation logic to ensure that data is consistent and valid. For example, the transaction model validates that the amount is a positive number.

In summary, the Financial Management API is a secure and scalable API for managing financial transactions and data. The API uses a RESTful design and token-based authentication. The middleware handles requests and responses, and the model represents the data and business logic of the application.
